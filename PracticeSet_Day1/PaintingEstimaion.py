# We want to estimate the cost of painting a property. Interior wall painting cost is Rs.18 per sq.ft. and exterior wall painting cost is Rs.12 per sq.ft.
# Take input as
# 1. Number of Interior walls
# 2. Number of Exterior walls
# 3. Surface Area of each Interior 
# 4. Wall in units of square feet
# Surface Area of each Exterior Wall in units of square feet
# If a user enters zero  as the number of walls then skip Surface area values as User may donâ€™t  want to paint that wall.
# Calculate and display the total cost of painting the property
# Example 1:
# 6
