1. Problem Statement

A washing machine works on the principle of Fuzzy System, the weight of clothes put inside it for washing is uncertain But based on weight measured by sensors, it decides time and water level which can be changed by menus given on the machine control area.  

For low level water, the time estimate is 25 minutes, where approximately weight is between 2000 grams or any nonzero positive number below that.

For medium level water, the time estimate is 35 minutes, where approximately weight is between 2001 grams and 4000 grams.

For high level water, the time estimate is 45 minutes, where approximately weight is above 4000 grams.

Assume the capacity of machine is maximum 7000 grams

Where approximately weight is zero, time estimate is 0 minutes.

Write a function which takes a numeric weight in the range [0,7000] as input and produces estimated time as output is: “OVERLOADED”, and for all other inputs, the output statement is

“INVALID INPUT”.

Input should be in the form of integer value –

Output must have the following format –

Time Estimated: Minutes

Example:

Input value
2000

Output value
Time Estimated: 25 minutes

2. Problem Statement

The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each alphabet in the plaintext or messages is shifted by a number of places down the alphabet.
For example,with a shift of 1, P would be replaced by Q, Q would become R, and so on.
To pass an encrypted message from one person to another, it is first necessary that both parties have the ‘Key’ for the cipher, so that the sender may encrypt and the receiver may decrypt it.
Key is the number of OFFSET to shift the cipher alphabet. Key can have basic shifts from 1 to 25 positions as there are 26 total alphabets.
As we are designing custom Caesar Cipher, in addition to alphabets, we are considering numeric digits from 0 to 9. Digits can also be shifted by key places.
For Example, if a given plain text contains any digit with values 5 and keyy =2, then 5 will be replaced by 7, “-”(minus sign) will remain as it is. Key value less than 0 should result into “INVALID INPUT”

Example 1:
Enter your PlainText: All the best
Enter the Key: 1

The encrypted Text is: Bmm uif Cftu

Write a function CustomCaesarCipher(int key, String message) which will accept plaintext and key as input parameters and returns its cipher text as output.

3. Problem Statement

We want to estimate the cost of painting a property. Interior wall painting cost is Rs.18 per sq.ft. and exterior wall painting cost is Rs.12 per sq.ft.

Take input as
1. Number of Interior walls
2. Number of Exterior walls
3. Surface Area of each Interior 4. Wall in units of square feet
Surface Area of each Exterior Wall in units of square feet

If a user enters zero  as the number of walls then skip Surface area values as User may don’t  want to paint that wall.

Calculate and display the total cost of painting the property
Example 1:

Total estimated Cost : 1847.4 INR

Note: Follow in input and output format as given in above example

4. Problem Statement

There are total n number of Monkeys sitting on the branches of a huge Tree. As travelers offer Bananas and Peanuts, the Monkeys jump down the Tree. If every Monkey can eat k Bananas and j Peanuts. If total m number of Bananas and p number of Peanuts are offered by travelers, calculate how many Monkeys remain on the Tree after some of them jumped down to eat.
At a time one Monkeys gets down and finishes eating and go to the other side of the road. The Monkey who climbed down does not climb up again after eating until the other Monkeys finish eating.
Monkey can either eat k Bananas or j Peanuts. If for last Monkey there are less than k Bananas left on the ground or less than j Peanuts left on the ground, only that Monkey can eat Bananas(<k) along with the Peanuts(<j).
Write code to take inputs as n, m, p, k, j and return  the number of Monkeys left on the Tree.
    Where, n= Total no of Monkeys
        k= Number of eatable Bananas by Single Monkey (Monkey that jumped down last may get less than k Bananas)
        j = Number of eatable Peanuts by single Monkey(Monkey that jumped down last may get less than j Peanuts)
        m = Total number of Bananas
        p  = Total number of Peanuts
Remember that the Monkeys always eat Bananas and Peanuts, so there is no possibility of k and j having a value zero

Example 1:
Input Values    
20
2
3
12
12

Output Values
Number of  Monkeys left on the tree:10

Note: Kindly follow  the order of inputs as n,k,j,m,p as given in the above example. And output must include  the same format  as in above example(Number of Monkeys left on the Tree:)
For any wrong input display INVALID INPUT

5. Problem Statement

Chain Marketing Organization has has a scheme for income generation, through which its members generate income for themselves. The scheme is such that suppose A joins the scheme and makes R and V to join this scheme  then A is Parent Member of R and V who are child Members. When any member joins the scheme then the parent gets total commission of 10% from each of its child members.
Child members receive commission of 5% respectively. If a Parent member does not have any member joined under him, then he gets commission of 5%.
Take name of the members joining the scheme as input.
Display how many members joined the scheme including parent member.Calculate the Total commission gained by each members in the scheme. The fixed amount for joining the scheme is Rs.5000 on which commission will be generated
SchemeAmount = 5000

Example 1: When there are more than one child members 
Input : (Do not give input prompts.Accept values as follows. )
Amit                     //Enter parent Member as this
Y                           //Enter Y if  Parent member has child members otherwise enter N
Rajesh,Virat        //Enter names of child members of Amit in comma separated
Output:(Final Output must be in format given below.)
TOTAL MEMBERS:3
COMISSION DETAILS
Amit: 1000 INR
Rajesh :250 INR
Virat: 250 INR

Example 2: When there is only one child member in the hierarchy
Input :
Amit
Y
Rajesh
Output:
Total Members: 2 
Comission Details
Amit: 500 INR
Rajesh: 250 INR
